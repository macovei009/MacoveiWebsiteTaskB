# Macovei Website

Welcome to my Read me file.
	This website was created with HTML5, CSS , NodeJS and Javascript.
	There are several CSS3 effects such as: transitions (i.e the contact form send button), border radius(Used to give rounded corners to the photos in the home page) and media queries used to define responsive design.


To navigate through the website, please use the navigation bar at the top of the page. Click on the following icons on the navigation bar as follows:

	HOME

•	If you click the logo in the left side of the header, it will take you to the homepage
•	And if you click the home page on the navigation bar, My Home Page comes up.    
•	I have a banner with a form and a subscribe button for newsletter that slides in from the left 
•	It is followed by a loop video
•	There are 4 sections and each section divide the page in 2 - a short description of the what I can offer and a photo.
•	In the bottom of the page there is a gallery with links to HTML, CSS, Java Script.

	Gallery
•	There is a js powered gallery that makes the photos bigger if you click on them. 

	Skills 
  
•	On this page are the  required completed tasks starting with:

•	1. Geolocation map that has a button called "Click to see the magic". When you press it, a window will pop op to ask for your permission to acces your location.
Once you press Allow, it will show you the Latitude and the Longitude as well as a leaflet powered map with a pin to your location.

•	2. Canvas-This shows the use of squares, circles, text, lines and colour can be used on the canvas.

•	9. Transitions - Once you bring the mouse over the coloured image of the cat, it will change the color to black and white photo.(applting a filter)


	About
•	This is a blank page for now

	Chat
•	Once you click on Chat page, it will bring you to another page that contains the chat. However if you try to Join the chatroom it will not work as you will have to open a terminal in visual studio code and opening the server through the node server.js command. Once opened, you have to go to http://localhost:5000/ and join the chat. You can open several tabs, joining  with different usernames and see how the chat is working in real-time. I tried to implement the chat in a page with the rest of the website having a header, main, and a navigation for the other pages of the website however I couldn't find a solution yet. For now, it only shows that the web socket is working independently.


	Contact
•	This is a contact form with js validation 

• You can enter your full name, email, and message . You can try and see how the validation works.



Thank you for taking your time to visit my website and read this file.
